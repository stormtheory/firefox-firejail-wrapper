# Firefox Sandboxing with Firejail wrapper
Wrapper for firejail for the purpose of sandboxing the Mozilla Firefox browser. This wrapper allows for seamless intergration of the sandbox and your computer environment. All firefox commands get intercepted by the wrapper's python script and then safely runs the sandbox. After the sandbox launches firefox it will make sure that the sandbox is working. If the sandbox is not registered it will pkill the program, in this case firefox.

# The Profile
The goal for this profile is to create a very secure but yet usable firefox sandbox. Firefox can only read or save files to ~/Downloads directory. If you need to upload something you have to move it to the downloads directory. This protects your files from being read or stolen without your knowledge. For Example: blocks ssh keys from being read/stolen which has been a problem before and general homespace.

# System Requirements
In order to use this, firejail must be installed. Tested with firejail-0.9.72. 
Firejail can be found in your local software center or https://sourceforge.net/projects/firejail/

At this time Ubuntu/Mint is only tested to be supported. This will not work for App Images or Flatpak installs. If there is interest in other Linux families please let me know. 

# Overview of Data Flow
Runs from /sandbox where firefox.profile and firefox-jail.py lives. 
The firefox-launcher in /sandbox is the orginal 'firefox' command script that comes with the firefox package from mozilla. This is moved to /sandbox and renamed from /usr/bin/firefox.
The CLI command firefox which is found in /usr/bin/firefox is softlink'd to /sandbox/firefox-jail.py

NOTE: The install of the softlink will have to happen after each update of the firefox package. 
If the wrapper is to be used as designed it is recommended to add the install script to your automatic update post scripts.
